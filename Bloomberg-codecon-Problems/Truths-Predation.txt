On planet Dorne in galaxy Harrenhal, there exist three types of animals: Wampa, Nexu and Tribble. Wampa can eat Nexu, Nexu can eat Tribble, and Tribble can eat Wampa.
Dorne has N animals, numbered from 1 to N, which are each one of the 3 types.
A troll named Horda will tell you K clues about these animals. Each piece of information has one of the two forms below:

1 X Y : this tells you that x and y are of the same type
2 X Y : this tells you that x can eat y
Being a troll, some of the clues given are false. The clue is false if it satisfies any of the three conditions below, otherwise it's true:

X or Y is larger than N
The clue states X can eat X
The clue conflicts with a true clue before
Your task is to process all clues and detect the number of false clues.


Input Specifications

The first line will contain a number N ( 1 <= N <= 1000 ) denoting the number of animals on Dorne and K (1 <= K <= 1000 ) 
denoting the number of clues Harda will provide. This will be followed by K lines, each with three positive integers. The first number C (1 <= C <= 2) will tell you which type of clue this is, followed by X and Y (1 <= X,Y <= N).


Output Specifications

Your program will output a single integer denoting the number of false clues provided by the troll.
